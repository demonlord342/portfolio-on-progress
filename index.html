            <h2>What Iâ€™m All About</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m all about learning cool stuff, whether itâ€™s coding games, exploring AI, or geeking out over robots. Right now, Iâ€™m working on a game that Iâ€™m super excited about. When Iâ€™m not coding or thinking about AI, Iâ€™m probably gaming or planning my next creative project.
                Oh, and this portfolio? I built it myselfâ€”figuring things out as I went along. My big goal? To create a game that people actually love and maybe learn some Blender on the side. Itâ€™s all about taking things one step at a time!

            <h2>About my work</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
            <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Beyond coding and gaming, Iâ€™m someone who loves experimenting with creative designs and learning new skills. This portfolio is just one example of how I like to bring my ideas to life, blending my passion for tech and creativity.
                Game development and design are where I feel most at home, but Iâ€™m always excited to explore new tools and challenges. Building interactive experiences and solving problems through code is something I genuinely enjoy.
                I believe every project teaches me something new, and I canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes me next. Thanks for taking the time to check out my work!</p>
